# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Task-02 (Intern Project)

This project is all about exploring the Titanic passenger data like a pirate exploring a treasure map. We used Python and fancy libraries to chart the data, compare prices and ages, and see how everything connects. We found some clues about who might have survived, but there's much more to discover!
